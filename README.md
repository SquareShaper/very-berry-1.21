# Very Berry Mod

## Features
Adds 2 new berries to the game - the Rimeberry and the Fireshine Berry. 

# Berries
## Rimeberry
Can be found in snowy biomes, like Jagged Peaks and Snowy Slopes. The berries grow on a bush like Sweet Berries, but the bush can only grow on snow blocks!

## Fireshine Berry
Can be found in the Nether Wastes biome, hanging from the ceiling. These hanging plants can be climbed and berry-bearing parts of the plant can be right-clicked to harvest Fireshine Berries! Fireshine Berries provide as much hunger and saturation as Sweet Berries, but also give you a short burst of Fire Resistance, making your Nether journey a bit more safe!
