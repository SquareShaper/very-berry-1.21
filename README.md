# Very Berry Mod

## Features
Adds 2 new berries to the game - the Rimeberry and the Fireshine Berry. 
  
# Berries
## Rimeberry
Can be found in snowy biomes, like Jagged Peaks and Snowy Slopes. The berries grow on a bush like Sweet Berries, but the bush can only grow on snow blocks! Rimeberries give a very short Resistance buff when consumed.

## Fireshine Berry
Can be found in the Nether Wastes biome, hanging from the ceiling. These hanging plants can be climbed and berry-bearing parts of the plant can be right-clicked to harvest Fireshine Berries! Fireshine Berries provide as much hunger and saturation as Sweet Berries, but also give you a short burst of Fire Resistance, making your Nether journey a bit more safe!

## Rimeberry Muffins
These muffins are quite satiating, for a fruity snack! They also provide you with a short, but moderately powerful burst of Resistance.

## Fireshine Berry Juice
Juicing these berries not only increases their nutritional value, but also prolongs the Fire Resistance effect they give!
