# New stuff
Soul berries (can grow on soul soil)\
Bone berries (can grow when skeletons die)\
Basalt berries, grow vertically up from basalt columns, imitating the columns\
Void berries, that grow underneath the small end islands between the bigger, continental islands. There's a small critter that can be tempted with chorus fruit, and they automatically pick berries from the berry stalks, swapping with the chorus fruit they are given. Void berries give you the voidhopper effect, making you launch upwards when you fall below y = 10 or so in the end.   
Berry paste - from grindstone  
Bone paste can be turned into bone meal, by drying it (campfire?)  
Void paste is for drugs! Basalt paste is for drugs! erm, I mean, elixirs  
Soul berries, what do they do... (they give you a new status effect, that lets you phase through 1 layer of blocks)  
Soul paste is for making soul pet feed, bind the souls of your pet to you!
