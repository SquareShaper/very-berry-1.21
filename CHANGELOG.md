# 1.0.3
Added the Voidberries, along with a new block, the Voidberry Moss!  
They're currently a work in progress, but you can access them from the creative mode inventory  
Consuming a Voidberry gives you a new status effect, Voidskipping! It allows you to traverse the void  
between the end islands easier, by propelling you upwards, "skipping" along the void. Sneaking while having the
buff shoots you further up, allowing to get back on the end islands. 

# 1.0.2
Changed the texture for the Fireshine Berry Growths  
Reduced the frequency at which the Fireshine Berry Growths are generated  
Made the Fireshine Berry Growths actually drop their berries when destroyed  
Made all foods with status effects (aka. everything edible in this mod) edible even when at full hunger. 

# 1.0.1
Swapped icon to the rimeberry texture, instead of the autogenerated text. 

# 1.0.0
Initial release
